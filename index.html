    <h1><br> My journey with coding </h1>
    <ul>
        First off, I started coding with Qbasic. It was taught to us at our school. Though it is not a powerful language, it provided me a kick-start 
        needed to embark on my journey in coding.
        Pretty soon, I started making calculators with it and then I was introduced to SQL. I personally did not like the language that much and with it came a temporary hault
        in my experiment with coding.
        My interest was rekindled when I came across game engines. I downloaded Unity3D and then started fiddling with it. I learnt 
        a little bit of C++, which is essential to make games. Of late, I've been introduced to HTML, and have liked it a lot. I intend to learn more about 
        web development in the future.
