    <h1>My journey with coding</h1>
    <ul>
        I first started coding with qbasic. It was taught to us at the school. Though it is not a powerful language, it provided me with a kick-start 
        needed to embark on my journey in coding.
        Pretty soon I started making calculators with it and then I was introduced to SQL. I personally did not like the language that much and with it I stopped coding.
        My interest was rekindled when I got to know about game engines. I downloaded Unity3D and then started doing stuff there. I learnt 
        little bit of C++, which was essetial to make games. Now I got introduced to html aswell, and I liked it a lot. I intend to learn more about 
        web deevelopment in future.
